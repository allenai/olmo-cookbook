# Filter Feature Implementation Summary

I have successfully implemented the requested filtering feature for `olmo-cookbook-eval results`. Here's what was added:

## 🏗️ Core Components Added

### 1. New Classes in `datalake.py`

**FilterTuple Class**
- Represents filter criteria with doc_ids and task_names
- Handles loading from file with support for:
  - Single or multiple doc IDs
  - Single or multiple task names  
  - Comment lines (starting with #)
  - Various tuple formats

**MetricsFiltered Class** 
- Extends MetricsAll to handle filtered predictions
- Fetches raw prediction data from datalake
- Recalculates metrics over filtered subsets
- Methods:
  - `_get_predictions_count()`: Get number of prediction files
  - `_get_predictions_data()`: Fetch predictions for task index
  - `_get_metrics_metadata()`: Get task metadata 
  - `_should_include_doc()`: Apply filter logic
  - `_recalculate_metrics()`: Aggregate filtered results

### 2. Enhanced Results Module (`results.py`)

**New Functions**
- `load_filter_tuples()`: Load filter tuples from file
- `make_filtered_dashboard_table()`: Create dashboard with filtered metrics
- `print_filter_report()`: Display filtering statistics

### 3. CLI Integration (`cli/eval.py`)

**New Options**
- `--filter-include <path>`: Only include matching items
- `--filter-exclude <path>`: Exclude matching items
- Mutually exclusive validation
- Integrated with existing result display logic

## 📝 Filter File Format

```python
# Comments supported with #
(doc_id, ["task_name1", "task_name2"])
([doc_id1, doc_id2], ["task_name"])
(doc_id, ["single_task"])
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

```bash
# Include specific items only
olmo-cookbook-eval results --dashboard my-dash --tasks "arc_challenge:mc" --filter-include subset.txt

# Exclude problematic items
olmo-cookbook-eval results --dashboard my-dash --tasks "arc_challenge:mc" --filter-exclude outliers.txt

# Works with all existing options
olmo-cookbook-eval results --dashboard my-dash --tasks "task1" "task2" --models "model1" --filter-include items.txt --format json
```

## 📊 Output Features

**Filter Report (in table format)**
```
📊 Filter Report (included items):
--------------------------------------------------
  arc_challenge:mc: 3/1119 items (0.3%)
  hellaswag:mc: 50/10042 items (0.5%)
```

**Compatibility**
- Works with all output formats (table, JSON, CSV)
- Maintains existing sorting and display options
- Compatible with named task groups
- Handles missing tasks and error reporting

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

**Data Flow**
1. Load filter tuples from file
2. For each experiment:
   - Get prediction count from datalake
   - Fetch raw predictions and metadata for each task
   - Apply filtering based on doc_ids and task_names
   - Recalculate primary metrics as averages
3. Create filtered metrics objects with same interface as MetricsAll
4. Display results with filter statistics

**Error Handling**
- Validates mutually exclusive options
- Graceful handling of missing prediction data
- Skip-on-fail support for robustness
- Clear error messages for invalid filter files

## ✅ Testing Completed

- [x] Filter tuple parsing (simple and complex formats)
- [x] Comment handling in filter files  
- [x] CLI option validation (mutual exclusion)
- [x] Filter logic integration
- [x] Results display and reporting
- [x] Error handling paths

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

**Modified:**
- `src/cookbook/eval/datalake.py` - Added FilterTuple and MetricsFiltered classes
- `src/cookbook/eval/results.py` - Added filtering functions and filter reporting
- `src/cookbook/cli/eval.py` - Added CLI options and integration logic

**Created:**
- `test_filter.txt` - Simple test filter file
- `example_filter.txt` - Complex filter examples
- `FILTER_FEATURE_DOCS.md` - User documentation

The implementation is complete and ready for use! The feature handles all the requirements from the specification:

✅ Fetches prediction-level data from datalake  
✅ Supports include/exclude filtering modes
✅ Recalculates metrics over filtered subsets
✅ Maintains compatibility with existing MetricsAll interface
✅ Provides clear filtering reports
✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing CLI workflow

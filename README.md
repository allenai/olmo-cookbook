# OLMo Cookbook

OLMost every recipe you need to experiment with the OLMo family of models.

## How To Train an OLMo Model

### Prepare your environments

#### Local
1) Install the cookbook CLI

```shell
pip install -e .[all]
```

2) Set up your environment

```shell
gcloud auth application-default login
gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project ai2-allennlp
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=ai2-allennlp
```

Optional: (Only if you are using Weka storage for token files)
```shell
  export WEKA_ENDPOINT_URL=<weka-endpoint-url>
  export WEKA_PROFILE=WEKA
```
*Note: Make sure you have WEKA and S3 profiles in your ~/.aws/config and ~/.aws/credentials files.*

#### Remote (Beaker)

1) Create a `Beaker` user account, request access to AI2 clusters, and create a Beaker user token.
2) Set up your workspace

```shell
olmo-cookbook prepare-user-workspace \
  --workspace <workspace> \
  --beaker-token <beaker-token> \
  --aws-config <aws-config> \
  --aws-credentials <aws-credentials> \
  --wandb-api-key <wandb-api-key>
```
*Note: Weka / R2 endpoint urls only need to be set if you are using them for storage.*

### Build your training configuration

See `src/cookbook/recipes/train-1b-1xC-dclm.yaml` for an example to clone.

*Note: This cookbook relies on `beaker-py` under the hood and thus requires committing and pushing changes to configuration files before launching a job.*

### Launch your training job

1) `olmo-cookbook launch -c src/cookbook/recipes/train-1b-1xC-dclm.yaml`
2) Follow the interactive prompts. A link to the `Beaker` job will be provided upon successful submission.
3) Monitor your training job in `wandb` or the `Beaker` UI.

## How To Evaluate an OLMo Model

### Convert Checkpoint

#### For models trained with [OLMo](https://github.com/allenai/olmo)

```shell
olmo-cookbook-eval convert \
  "/oe-training-default/kevinf/checkpoints/OLMo-medium/peteish7-medlr/step477000" \
  -t olmo2 \
  --use-beaker \
  --huggingface-tokenizer allenai/dolma2-tokenizer
```

#### For models trained with [OLMo-core](https://github.com/allenai/olmo-core)

```shell
olmo-cookbook-eval convert \
  "/oe-training-default/ai2-llm/checkpoints/peteish32-anneal/OLMo2-32Bparams-5Ttokens-100Banneal/step11921" \
  -t olmo-core \
  --use-beaker \
  --huggingface-tokenizer allenai/OLMo-2-1124-7B
```

#### For models trained with [OLMo-core-v2](https://github.com/allenai/olmo-core-v2)

```shell
olmo-cookbook-eval convert \
  "/oe-training-default/ai2-llm/checkpoints/mattj/olmo2-1b-1xC-all-dressed-noDedup-89adf213/step12202" \
  -t olmo-core-v2 \
  --use-beaker
```


### Run Evaluation

**WARNING**

If using models trained with OLMo Core v2 converted before  **May 7, 2025**,
make sure to use `--model-args dtype=bfloat16` to avoid NaN with vLLM.
ðŸ›‘ ðŸ›‘ ðŸ›‘ ðŸ›‘ ðŸ›‘ ðŸ›‘

```shell
olmo-cookbook-eval evaluate \
  "/oe-training-default/ai2-llm/checkpoints/OLMoE/a0125/olmoe-8x1b-newhp-newds-dolmino-seed-42/step23842-hf" \
  --tasks core:mc --tasks mmlu:mc --tasks mmlu:rc --tasks gen \
  --priority high \
  --cluster aus80g \
  --num-gpus 1 \
  --model-backend vllm \
  --dashboard olmoe-0125
```

Example evaluating a HuggingFace model:

```shell
olmo-cookbook-eval evaluate \
  mistralai/Mistral-Small-24B-Base-2501
  --tasks gen-no-jp
  --priority high
  --cluster aus80g
  --num-gpus 1
  --model-backend vllm
  --dashboard peteish32
```

### Get results

```shell
olmo-cookbook-eval results --dashboard peteish32 --tasks olmo2:int:mc
```

This will return a table that includes the results using internal MC tasks from olmo 2 days.
You can also provide a list of `--tasks` to get results for specific tasks.

You can also provide a list of `--models` regular expressions to filter the models by name.

You can use `--format json` to see full results when model names are long.



## Running OLMo-core script

You can launch any OLMo core training script using the cookbook.
By default, any script in [src/scripts/train](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo-core/tree/main/src/scripts/train) can be launched.

Here's an example of how to train a 1B model for 50B tokens on 16 GPUs on the `ai2/augusta-google-1` cluster.

```shell
olmo-cookbook-core launch \
  -d dolmino50 \
  -m OLMo2-1B \
  -n 50e9T \
  -i petew/olmo-core-tch260cu126-v2.0.1 \
  -p urgent \
  -c ai2/augusta-google-1 \
  -g 16
```

Let's break down the command:

- `-d dolmino50`: The data mix to use for training. This data mix is at [data/mixes/dolmino50.yaml](src/cookbook/data/mixes), but you can use any path to a data mix file (i.e., a plain text file with a list on npy tokens files)
- `-m OLMo2-1B`: The model to train. This is the configuration [src/scripts/train/OLMo2-1B.py](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo-core/blob/main/src/scripts/train/OLMo2-1B.py). You can also provide a path to any training script written in OLMo-core.
- `-n 50e9T`: The number of tokens to train on (50B tokens).
- `-i petew/olmo-core-tch260cu126-v2.0.1`: The image to use for training.
- `-p urgent`: The priority of the job.
- `-c ai2/augusta-google-1`: The cluster to use for training.
- `-g 16`: The number of GPUs to use for training.

Use the `--dry-run` flag to print the command without launching the job; to view all available flags, run `olmo-cookbook-core launch --help`.

At the moment, we pin OLMo-core to commit [`2f66fd9`](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo-core/tree/2f66fd95c17c9779be9930f8fb80803293c2dc30), but you can override this by setting the `--olmo-core-commit-hash` flag.


## EC2 CLI

The EC2 CLI is a tool for managing EC2 instances. We will describe its use by example.

First, you want to install the cookbook CLI.

```shell
pip install -e .
```

Then, you can create a cluster of instances; by default, instances will be `i4i.xlarge` and will be tagged with the project name and owner; they will use the `us-east-1` region and use your SSH key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

Let's say you wanna create a cluster named `chipstest`:

```shell
olmo-cookbook-ec2 create --name chipstest --number 5 --instance i4i.2xlarge --detach
```

This will create 5 instances as part of a cluster with the name `chipstest`; the `--detach` flag means that the
process will return immediately and the instances will be created in the background.

You can check the status of the instances by listing them:

```shell
olmo-cookbook-ec2 list --name chipstest
```

After the instances are create, you wanna set up AWS credentials and D2TK pipeline on them. You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
olmo-cookbook-ec2 setup-d2tk --name chipstest
```

To run a command on all instances in the cluster, you can use the following command:

```shell
olmo-cookbook-ec2 run --name chipstest --command "echo 'Hello, world!'"
```

But, most likely you wanna queue a bunch of jobs to run on the instances. You can do this by creating a directory with as many bash scripts as job units, and then running the following command:

```shell
olmo-cookbook-ec2 map --name chipstest --scripts-dir tmp/test_scripts
```

This will run all the scripts in the `tmp/test_scripts` directory on all the instances in the cluster.

Once you are done with the jobs, you can terminate the cluster:

```shell
olmo-cookbook-ec2 terminate --name chipstest
```

This will terminate all the instances in the cluster and delete the cluster.

## Poor Man's Ray CLI

The PMR CLI is a minimal alternative to Ray for distributed data processing on EC2 instances. It is primarily designed to work with version 2 of the Dolma toolkit.

First, install the cookbook CLI:

```shell
pip install -e .[all]
```

The CLI offers several commands for managing EC2 instances and executing tasks:

### Create a cluster of instances

```shell
poormanray create --name chipstest --number 5 --instance i4i.2xlarge --detach
```

This will create 5 instances as part of a cluster named `chipstest`. The `--detach` flag makes the process return immediately while instances are created in the background.

### Storage Configuration

You can customize the storage configuration for your instances using the `--storage-type` and `--storage-size` options.
By default, storage is not configured (and thus left to whatever AWS defaults to).

```shell
poormanray create --name chipstest --number 5 --instance i4i.2xlarge --storage-type gp3 --storage-size 100 --detach
```

This will create 5 instances as part of a cluster named `chipstest` with 100GB of gp3 storage.


### List instances in a cluster

```shell
poormanray list --name chipstest --region us-east-1
```

### Set up AWS credentials and D2TK pipeline on instances

```shell
poormanray setup-d2tk --name chipstest --ssh-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Run a command on all instances in a cluster

```shell
poormanray run --name chipstest --command "echo 'Hello, world!'" --ssh-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### Distribute and run scripts across instances

You can distribute multiple scripts across your instances by creating a directory with bash scripts and using the `map` command:

```shell
poormanray map --name chipstest --script tmp/test_scripts --ssh-key-path ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This will distribute all executable scripts in the `tmp/test_scripts` directory evenly across all instances in the cluster.

### Terminate instances

```shell
poormanray terminate --name chipstest --region us-east-1
```

This will terminate all instances in the cluster.

By default, instances will be `i4i.xlarge`, tagged with the project name and owner, use the `us-east-1` region, and use your SSH key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

### Common Command Line Options

All PMR CLI commands support the following options:

| Option | Short | Default | Description |
|--------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--name` | `-n` | (required) | Cluster name |
| `--instance-type` | `-t` | `i4i.xlarge` | EC2 instance type |
| `--number` | `-N` | `1` | Number of instances to create |
| `--region` | `-r` | `us-east-1` | AWS region |
| `--timeout` | `-T` | None | Command timeout in seconds |
| `--owner` | `-o` | Current user | Owner name for tagging instances |
| `--instance-id` | `-i` | None | Specific instance ID(s) to target (can be used multiple times) |
| `--ssh-key-path` | `-k` | `~/.ssh/id_rsa` | Path to SSH private key |
| `--ami-id` | `-a` | None | Custom AMI ID (defaults to latest Amazon Linux 2) |
| `--detach/--no-detach` | `-d/-nd` | `--no-detach` | Whether to detach after command execution |
| `--command` | `-c` | None | Command to execute on instances |
| `--script` | `-s` | None | Path to script file or directory to execute |

Note that you can provide either `--command` or `--script`, but not both. When using `--script` with a directory path, all executable files in that directory will be distributed across the instances.
